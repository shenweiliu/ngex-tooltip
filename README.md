# ngex-tooltip

The repository contains the source code and demo application of the Angular ngex-tooltip. Please see the details of the ngex-tooltip package on the [npm site](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ngex-tooltip).  

## Angular Version Compatibility

The applications are set with the Angular 13. It works well with the `ngex-tooltip` library tool built with tha Angular 12 ViewEngine (non-Ivy) compilation options. if compiled with the Ivy Parial (not provided here), it can only work on the applications with the Angular 13 and latest version of the Angular 12.

The base directive code files should work with the Angular versions 8 - 13. If you need to have the `ngex-tooltip` work with any previous version other than 13, you can update the package.json for the required versions and update the `node_modules` by running the `npm install` for the `ang-content` project.
